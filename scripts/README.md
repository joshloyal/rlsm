# Simulation and Real Data Analysis Scripts

Simulation and real data analysis scripts. The code was original written to run on an HPC cluster. 

## How to Run

The following commands run the simulations or real data analysis and produce the figures in the corresponding section.

### Section 4 (Simulation Study)

These commands run the simulations:

```bash
>>> python simulation.py
>>> python process.py
```

To produce Figures 2-4, you need to run the cells in the corresponding Jupyter notebook:

```bash
>>> jupyter notebook Simulation Plots.ipynb
```

### Section 5.2 (Lazega Lawyers Advice Network)

To produce the figures and results, you will need to run the cells in the corresponding Jupyter notebook:

```bash
>>> jupyter notebook Lazega Lawyers.ipynb
```

### Section 5.3 (Intra-Organizational Information-Sharing Network)

To produce the figures and results, you will need to run the cells in the corresponding Jupyter notebook:

```bash
>>> jupyter notebook Information Sharing.ipynb
```

### Section 5.4 (Illinois High School Friendship Network)

To produce the figures and results, you will need to run the cells in the corresponding Jupyter notebook:

```bash
>>> jupyter notebook Illinois Highschool.ipynb
```
